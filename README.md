### Submitting
Issues can be [submitted](https://github.com/MCGamerNetwork/Issues/issues/new) at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/MCGamerNetwork/Issues/issues).

### Do:

* Follow the [formatting guide](#formatting) to the best of your ability, making sure to include steps to reproduce your issue
* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
* Verify the validity and/or plausibility of your issue
* Be clear and concise in your description
* You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) to spice up your issue submission a little bit.
* Use a *vanilla* environment, making sure to remove any client-side mods
* Assume that all [rules of the MCGamer forums](http://www.minecraftsurvivalgames.com/threads/mcsg-updated-rules-version-3-0.12254/) apply to the issue tracker

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response; we look through all issue reports submitted, bumping an issue will not help
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add pointless comments such as "first", :+1:, +1 or "I like this idea"
* Submit issues that are general suggestions, as opposed to *specific, technical* bugs or *confirmed* features
* Create disrespectful or inflammatory comments

## Formatting

Please format issues using the following formatting guidelines.

### Title

Provide a brief summary of the issue.

**Example**:

> Flint and steel won't work

### Label

If your issue is limited to a specific gametype or gametype(s), please use the appropriate pre-created labels. Generally, all bug reports should have the "bug" label at the very least. **If you find a bug related to our preview network, please label it with the "v2" label.**

### Description

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1. **The issue**

    This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.

2. **Steps to reproduce**

    If applicable, this section should provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.

3. **Miscellaneous information**

    Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections, such as screenshots.
